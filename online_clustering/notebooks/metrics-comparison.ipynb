       "['If you listen to some skeptics of the COVID-19 vaccines, you\\'ll hear various doubts about effectiveness and safety, which have not been validated by the data. To the contrary, the vaccines are working miraculously well and have been proven safe among many millions of recipients across the world. Another argument that certain fence-sitters may advance is that the government isn\\'t eager to give up control over people\\'s lives anyway, so why bother getting a set of injections against a virus that probably won\\'t kill you -- especially if the Powers That Be won\\'t allow your life to return to normal as a reward. I\\'m concerned that this latter concern is being vindicated by rhetoric from top officials and amplified in the media. Reaching herd immunity is a crucial goal that will allow American life to move past the pandemic. Incessantly telling people that getting inoculated is not an effective ticket back to freedom and normalcy is a mistake. A significant number of people might well internalize that message and reach the somewhat understandable conclusion that if the vaccines \\'aren\\'t good enough,\\' why even bother? This is dangerous and counter-productive.\\n\\nI have never been one of the swooning fans, or hardcore critics, of Dr. Anthony Fauci. In fact, I\\'ve often been put off by people in each of those camps. But I\\'ll admit that his politically-tinged equivocating in the school re-opening debate, his manipulative goalpost shifting, and messaging like this has been wearing on me:\\n\\nThat\\'s the way Israel has been framing their vaccination campaign, and they lead the world in shots administered, by a mile. They are explicitly incentivizing getting the jab by correctly treating it as the inside track back to an uninhibited life (plus offering free food and booze, which probably helps, too). We now know that the vaccines overwhelmingly protect immunized people -- not only against COVID symptoms, serious cases and death, but also from infection. This means that vaccinated people pose an extremely low risk of passing the disease to anyone else. In other words, they\\'re safe. People with whom they come into contact are also safe from them. Let them live life. Stop prattling on about how common activities still may not be safe even for vaccinated people for an indefinite period of time, and how we may need still to be masking up a year from now. Again, this stuff is needlessly demoralizing and counter-productive:\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for exasperated conservatives crying, \"fire Fauci,\" Allahpundit argues \\'be careful what you wish for.\\' But there are absolutely fair criticisms to be leveled, several of which are laid out bluntly by David Harsanyi in a piece I strongly you encourage to read and consider. An excerpt:\\n\\nI\\'ll leave you with two items. First, my straightforward layperson\\'s advice on what the official \\'recommendation\\' ought to be for Americans who are fully inoculated against COVID, followed by an ugly glimpse at how awful things are in the EU on the vaccine front:\\n\\n\\n\\nI know a lot of Americans on the Left tend to fetishize Europe, but the EU\\'s sclerotic bureaucracy and other factors are producing dreadful outcomes on getting life-saving doses into the arms of EU citizens. The Europeans certainly fancy themselves far more enlightened and \"pro-science\" than we are, and many Americans would agree. And yet, the good ole USA\\'s rate of doses administered per 100 residents is more than triple the EU\\'s rate, as of this week. Also, looking at the data above, I wonder if any British opponents of Brexit might be coming around to the view that they might have gotten that one wrong.',\n",

It wants to determine if an additional booster shot given six to 12 months after the first two doses would rev up the immune system enough to ward off a mutated virus.\\n\\nPfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, also are tweaking their vaccine recipe.

       " 'he speed of Britain’s vaccine roll-out will double in the next two months, the Government minister in charge of the programme has vowed.\\n\\nIt came as President Biden’s chief health adviser told a UK audience that it was possible to end the global pandemic through vaccination.\\n\\nDr Anthony Fauci, asked in a Science Museum webinar last night about whether the world could vaccinate its way out of the pandemic, said: “I believe that we can.” He added: “I believe that if we get a good global response with vaccinations we will be able to end this pandemic as we know it.”\\n\\nNadhim Zahawi, the vaccines deployment minister, said the UK roll-out had been “exemplary”, with 18.2 million first doses given by Tuesday night.\\n\\nHe said the infrastructure was in place to deliver “even greater doses”, with “double the rate of vaccination” in the next 10 to 11 weeks, compared with progress between December 8 and February 15. However it would be a “marathon” to vaccinate all adult Britons, with the programme only a third of the way towards its target.\\n\\nMr Zahawi said: “Now we are into the next sprint to offer the vaccine to all nine [priority] categories, which is 32 million people by the middle of April, and then ultimately to all the adult population by the end of July. I’m confident both in the vaccine supply and that we will meet our targets.”\\n\\nDr Fauci, reappointed by President Biden, told the webinar that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in use in the US, and the Oxford jab also being used in the UK, were offering good protection against the dominant “Kent” variant of Covid. But he said there was a “five-fold diminution in the efficacy” of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against the South African variant, which was yesterday announced in the Oval area of Lambeth, prompting “surge” testing.\\n\\nHe said extensive genomic surveillance of new strains was the way to suppress mutations. “If you get a good handle on that and you are able to modify your vaccines where appropriate, I believe that if we get a good global response with vaccinations we will be able to end this pandemic as we know it,” he said.\\n\\nDr Fauci also revealed his concerns about anti-vaccine propaganda, saying it could hinder attempts to immunise entire populations. “If we have a substantial proportion that does not want to get vaccinated, that would be a hindrance to reaching that goal of herd immunity,” he said.',\n",
